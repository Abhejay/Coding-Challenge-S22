# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Spring 2022)

Code is not 100% complete due to late application but will provide a walkthrough on my theory and what I have done on my code thus far

Theory:
Utilizing the Scikit Learn for Binary Classification
Logistic Regression Model


Explanation of the Code:
Divide the code into test and train set
Train test dataset using cap-shape, could have used other attributes possibly but was testing code.
